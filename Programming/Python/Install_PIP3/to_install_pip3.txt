Topic: To install pip and pip3 on MacOS Sierra
===============================================

Go to the link:
https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py

Copy the content to get-pip.py
Sudo -H python get-pip.py

This will install pip and pip3 at a same time.

Caveats:
If we download above file and install it does not work, just
copy and paste the contents.
