Headings 
==========

In order to write a title, just underline it::

    *****
    Title
    *****

    subtitle
    ########

    subsubtitle
    ***********
    and so on

Two rules: 

  * use at least as many characters as the length of the title
  * characters usage is quite flexible but be consistent

Normally, there are no heading levels assigned to certain characters as the 
structure is determined from the succession of headings. However, for the 
Python documentation, this convention is used which you may want to follow :

* `#` with overline, for parts
* `*` with overline, for chapters
* `=`, for sections
* `-`, for subsections
* `^`, for subsubsections
* `"`, for paragraphs
