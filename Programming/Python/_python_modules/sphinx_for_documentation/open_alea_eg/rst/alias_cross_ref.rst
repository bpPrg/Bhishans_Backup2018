More about aliases
==================

Directives can be used within aliases::

    .. |logo| image:: ../images/wiki_logo_openalea.png
        :width: 20pt
        :height: 20pt

Using this image alias, you can insert it easily in the text `|logo|`, like this |logo|. This is especially useful when dealing with complicated code. For instance, in order to include 2 images within a table do as follows::

    +---------+---------+-----------+
    | |logo|  | |logo|  | |longtext||
    +---------+---------+-----------+

+---------+---------+-----------+
| |logo|  | |logo|  | |longtext||
+---------+---------+-----------+

.. note:: Not easy to get exactly what you want though. 


Cross-referencing syntax
========================

.. todo:: to clarify

Cross-references are generated by many semantic interpreted text roles. 
Basically, you only need to write ``:role:`target```, and a link will be
created to the item named target of the type indicated by role. The 
linksâ€™s text will be the same as target.

You may supply an explicit title and reference target, like in reST direct
hyperlinks: ``:role:`title <target>``` will refer to target, but the link text
will be title.


.. note:: instead of :role:, you can use :ref:

Adding raw html
===============

.. todo:: check how it works 

.. raw:: html

    <html style="border:2px color:red">
    <tr>
    <td>column 1</td>
    <td>column 1</td>
    </tr>
    </html>

.. Here below are coded the different aliases, reference, citation
.. There do not appear like so in the text but can be use for references

.. |logo| image:: ../images/wiki_logo_openalea.png  
    :width: 20pt
    :height: 20pt
    :align: middle

.. |longtext| replace:: this is a longish text to include within a table and which is longer than the width of the column.


.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#footnote1] this is a footnote aimed at illustrating the footnote capability.

.. rubric:: Bibliography

.. [CIT2002] A citation
      (as often used in journals).
