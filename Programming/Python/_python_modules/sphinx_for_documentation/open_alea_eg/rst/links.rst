Internal and External Links
=============================

:Internal hyperlinks:

    All titles are considered as internal hyperlinks that may be refered to using this syntax::

        `Internal and External links`_

    You may also create hyperlink as follows::

        .. _begin:

    And then inserting ``begin_`` in your text. For instance, jump to the beginning of this document rst_tutorial_  

    .. note:: Note the underscore at the end ot the links

:External links:

    In order to link to external links simply use::

        `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_

    that is rendered as a normal hyperlink `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_. 


.. note:: If you have an underscore within the label/name, you got to escape it with a '\\' character.
