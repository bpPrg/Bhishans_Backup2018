====================================
Ref: https://github.com/dunovank/jupyter-themes

1. To see themes list
jt -l

2. To install themes
Open /Users/poudel/.jupyter/custom/custom.css

Edit this file.
e.g.

3. DO NOT CHANGE THEME
It does not look better, updated widgets look blurry and default is best!!
